# Passport-Authentication

This application consists of basic Register Login Logout functionalities using passport authentication in node.js. It uses a middleware 
called passport.js which has many plugins to authenticate someone example, Facebook, Twitter and google login. it also consists of simple
username plus password modules. it is easy to implement passport.js than writing own custom athentication model.

In this project, I used Bootstrap, node.js, express.js and MongoDB as a backend. MongoDB is used because the data is stored in JSON which 
is supported by all javascript frameworks.

This application also has some constraints to handle invalid entries like email id, pasword length. the password is hashed using brcypt 
module for security reasons.

Here, I used Express.js to handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
